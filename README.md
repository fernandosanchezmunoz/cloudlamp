This project aims to provide a modern cloud based implementation of the [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP) stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP). In particular, it addresses the following aspects of a traditional monolithic LAMP deployment
  - Frontend elastic on-demand scalability
  - Backend scalability and potential operations complexity
  - Full deployment and operations automation
